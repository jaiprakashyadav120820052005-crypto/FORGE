# FORGE — Project Planning & Execution Copilot

**AI Engineering Track · Team FORGE: Aditya Raj, Jai Prakash, Sidhant**

> **AI reads. Rules decide. Physics validates. Every number has verifiable proof.**

---

## ⚡ Executive Summary

Building physical robotics and embedded systems is notoriously fragmented and error-prone. Engineering teams and makers face scattered component datasheets, inconsistent vendor nomenclature (e.g. an "Arduino Nano" search returning ₹229 clones and ₹2,755 original boards on the same storefront), hidden costs (deceptive EMI monthly installments, shipping fees, out-of-stock items), and catastrophic electrical mismatches (voltage spikes, logic-level incompatibilities, insufficient motor driver current).

**FORGE** is an autonomous, end-to-end **Project Planning & Execution Copilot** that bridges the gap between high-level project ideation and verified hardware reality. It guides builders from initial skill discovery and resume analysis all the way to deterministic BOM generation, real-time market sourcing, electrical compatibility checking, physics-based component swapping, wiring diagrams, starter firmware generation, and automated live cart verification.

## 🌟 Key Capabilities

### 1. 🎯 Intelligent Discovery & Needs Matching
- **Interactive 9-Question Survey**: Evaluates career trajectory, experience level, programming languages, time commitment, budget (INR), available tools, existing hardware, project goals, and interest domains.
- **Resume / CV Evidence Extractor**: Ingests PDF, DOCX, or plain text resumes. Powered by Google Gemini with **mandatory exact quote verification**—every extracted skill, tool, or past project must link to verbatim text in the resume and requires explicit user confirmation.
- **Career Market Research**: Connects with TinyFish Search + Fetch to discover real-time industry and dream-job requirements (e.g., autonomous systems, ROS2, embedded perception).
- **12-Factor Deterministic Matcher**: Filters by hard constraints (budget, schedule, tooling) and scores compatibility across 12 deterministic criteria. Includes an interactive **Radial Fit Profile** chart.

### 2. 🏆 Competition Strategy & Shortlisting ("Build to Compete")
- Catalog of **18 competition-tailored builds** across **14 major robotics events** (RoboCup, Robocon, Line Maze, Combat Robotics, Formula Student, Autonomous Drone Racing, etc.).
- Outlines event constraints, safety considerations, estimated build hours, and parts availability index for the Indian market.
- **Direct 1-Click Planning & BOM Hand-off**:
  - Every competition project card features a direct **`⚡ Plan & Build BOM`** action button.
  - Instantly transitions from competition discovery to **Stage 4 (Planning & Execution)**, pre-loading the bot's complete architecture (10–15 parts), target budget, live vendor sourcing, What-If hardware optimizer, and pinout wiring diagram.
  - Seamlessly bridges competition requirements with immediate physical BOM execution—no manual searching or re-entry required.

### 3. ✦ Curated Star Projects
- **20 team-curated builds** spanning autonomous robotics, advanced control, FPGA, embedded Linux, power electronics, and more, stored separately in `core/project_data/star_projects.csv`.
- Search each project by name, domain, skills, or prerequisites; expand project cards to review tools, safety notes, effort, and estimated cost.
- Star-project cards are a curated discovery catalog and do not imply that every project has a ready-to-generate BOM.
- Star-catalog costs are rough estimates, not quotes. Prices for the QDD arm, CubeSat flatsat, and imitation-learning arm are withheld pending vendor-price verification.

### 4. 🧠 Hybrid Architecture Planning & BOM Generation
- **Pre-Verified Catalog (168 Projects)**: Comprehensive component lists across 16 robotics disciplines, drafted with engineering notes, quantities, and vendor search queries.
- **Deterministic Rule-Checked Builds**: 3 core robotic baselines (Line Follower, Obstacle Avoider, Bluetooth Mobile Robot) tested against thousands of combinatorial combinations across Microcontroller, Motor Driver, Motors, Battery, and Sensors.
- **Autonomous Ideation Copilot (Gemini + TinyFish)**: Free-text project ideation ("a solar-powered field rover with 4 mecanum wheels") resolves through a priority hierarchy:
  1. Previously learned & saved builds (free, instant)
  2. Exact catalog project match
  3. Deterministic keyword routing
  4. Similar catalog project suggestions
  5. Single structured Gemini call (cached permanently in `learned_projects.json` for zero-cost repeat access).

### 5. 🛒 Real-Time Market Sourcing & Evidence Ledger
- **Live Vendor Scraping**: Direct search and page extraction across major Indian component distributors (Robu.in, Robocraze, Sunrobotics, ElectronicsComp, Robokits, etc.).
- **Rules First, LLM Last**: Heuristic regex engine (`core/pagerules.py`) extracts prices, titles, and availability without consuming LLM tokens. Gemini serves as a strictly capped fallback and requires that the exact price digits exist inside the cited quote.
- **Anti-Fraud & Deception Filters**:
  - Automatically identifies and excludes EMI / installment pricing (e.g., "starts at ₹86/mo").
  - Rejects price ranges, accessory bundles, and shipping threshold text.
  - Clone vs. Original detection flags genuine boards priced differently than generic alternatives.
  - Flags suspiciously low prices with warnings (`UNUSUALLY LOW · CHECK`).
- **Cryptographic Evidence Ledger**: Auditable table with CSV export logging verification status, shop URL, UTC timestamp, extraction technique, and verbatim quote proof.

### 6. 🔬 Project Optimizer (What-If Hardware Swap Engine)
- **Multi-Metric Physics & Electrical Impact Simulation**: Swap any component (MCU, driver, motor, battery, sensor) and immediately see real-world impacts on:
  - **Speed & Torque**: RPM, stall torque, linear speed (m/s), wheel pushing force.
  - **Power & Runtime**: Standby vs peak current, battery discharge rates, operating minutes.
  - **Electrical Safety**: Logic level differences (e.g., 3.3V vs 5V level shifting), VIN tolerances, motor driver current limits.
  - **Compute & I/O**: Clock speed, RAM, Flash, ADC/PWM channels, and spare GPIO pins.
- **Atomic Swap State Management (`core/kept.py`)**: "Keep this replacement" commits the swap directly into the active bill, totals, and PDF export without cross-contaminating other catalog builds.

### 7. 📊 Part Specs & Side-by-Side Comparison
- **Part specs · typical datasheet values, best value in green when comparing**:
  - Curated, typed engineering specifications for all 231 parts in the library (`core/part_specs.py`), detailing supply voltages, logic levels, peak/stall currents, clock/memory, torque, range, and accuracy.
  - **Compare with other microcontrollers / motor drivers / sensors**: Put any component side-by-side against similar alternatives from the library. The best value in each spec row is highlighted in **green** (only where "better" is clearly defined, e.g. lower voltage dropout, higher clock speed, longer range, or lower price).

### 8. 🔌 Wiring & Firmware Studio
- **Dynamic Wiring Guide**: Visual pin-to-pin schematic, Mermaid-rendered device and signal map, and a pinout table generated from the active BOM.
- **Logic Level Warnings**: Proactively highlights missing level shifters, pull-up resistors, and power decoupling.
- **Starter Firmware Synthesis**: Generates ready-to-flash C++/Arduino or MicroPython code configured with the exact pinouts and sensors in the active BOM.
- **Wokwi starter bundle**: Download `diagram.json`, `sketch.ino`, and `wiring.mmd` for the active build. Import the files into a Wokwi project and start the simulation there; FORGE cannot create a project in your Wokwi account or start its remote simulator from the browser.

### 9. 🔬 Research What This Project Needs
- **Research what this project needs · Search + Fetch (free)**:
  - Discovers real-world build guides, open-source hardware projects, and tutorials using TinyFish **Search + Fetch** (free API, no quota used).
  - Extracts the exact components used in published guides accompanied by verbatim supporting quotes, allowing users to validate community-tested parts against the generated BOM.

### 10. 🚚 Delivery Optimizer & Cart Check
- **Vendor Consolidation**: Analyzes supplier distribution to minimize split shipments and reduce delivery costs.
- **Cart check · TinyFish Browser for robu.in and robocraze.com, Web Agent for other shops**:
  - **TinyFish Browser for robu.in and robocraze.com**: Automated cloud browser driven by Playwright with a fixed, deterministic script (opt-in, consumes zero agent step credits). Targets only the main product's own Add-to-Cart button with strict stock inspection, preventing false clicks on out-of-stock related items, and reads the real shop cart total.
  - **Web Agent for other shops**: Autonomous web agent that navigates arbitrary third-party storefronts or handles browser fallbacks with strict safety instructions (capped at 12 steps and 180 seconds, read-only, never log in, never enter payment details).

### 11. 📄 Audit & Export
- Interactive on-screen invoice with manual override controls and unverified price adjustments.
- Clean PDF bill of materials export with native Indian Rupee (`₹`) symbol formatting.

## 🛡️ Engineering Guardrails & Verifiability

| Guardrail | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **AI Reads, Rules Decide** | LLMs are restricted to parsing and naming. Deterministic formulas validate electrical voltage, current draw, and pricing math. |
| **Strict Quote Checking** | A price from any web page is accepted **only if the exact figure appears in the extracted quote**. |
| **Anti-EMI / Anti-Deception** | Regex filters discard EMI per month (e.g., "₹86/mo"), multi-pack totals, and delivery threshold numbers. |
| **Clone vs Original Audit** | Distinguishes between generic clones and genuine OEM boards, preventing skewed budget comparisons. |
| **Formula Injection Defense** | All values written to the Evidence Ledger and CSV exports are sanitized against spreadsheet formula injection (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`). |
| **Isolated Optimizer State** | Component swaps remain isolated to the target build (`core/kept.py`), preventing unwanted state leaks into other builds. |
| **Sandboxed Cart Verification** | The Playwright cloud browser runs a fixed script targeting only the primary product's Add-to-Cart button. The Web Agent is strictly instructed never to check out or enter user credentials. |
